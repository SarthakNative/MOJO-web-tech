## 🚀 Application Overview

This application is developed using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)**.

- **Frontend (Vercel):**  
  https://mojo-web-tech.vercel.app/

- **Backend (Render – Free Tier):**  
  https://mojo-web-tech.onrender.com/

---

## 🕒 Free Tier Hosting Notice (Render)

The backend is hosted on **Render Free Tier**, which puts the service to sleep after a period of inactivity.

Because of this, the **first request may take up to 30–60 seconds** while the server wakes up.

### How to start the application

If the application does not respond immediately:

1. Open the backend URL once to wake up the instance:  
   https://mojo-web-tech.onrender.com/
2. Wait for the initial response (up to 1 minute).
3. Refresh the frontend application and continue normally.

After the instance is active, the application works smoothly without further delay.
